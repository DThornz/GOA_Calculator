# GOA Calculator

## This code was made to work with MATLAB R2020b

## This code requires the following MATLAB Toolboxes:
1. Image Processing 
2. Computer Vision 

## What does this code do?

Given an input planar image of valve (example: aortic) the code will find the geometric orifice area (GOA) in cm<sup>2</sup> and output an the mask of the region along with an overlay using the original image. You must know at least one real world dimension of your image, either via a scale bar or knowledge of geometric dimensions (leaflet length, annular diamter, etc). Final output examples are shown below.
